            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a web developer based in Orlando, Florida. I focus on front end development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create websites and web apps. I incorporate development libraries for projects as needed. I'm always open to using new technologies and skills that fit a specific project.</p>
            <p>My web development journey started at the University of Central Florida in 2012. I graduated from there with a degree in Web Design in 2016. While at the university, I learned the fundamentals of how to code, how to design websites, and how to deliver complete projects.</p>
            <p>After school, I worked at BryteBridge for 6 years. While there I would develop hundreds of websites for the nonprofit clients. A full development process was created and refined over time to provide a service to clients that was exemplary and efficient. I also helped maintain the company's web infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Now I focus on learning new technologies and building projects. That work is showcased here. I am always trying to improve as a web developer.</p>
